# gesture-controlled-rc-car
A gesture-controlled RC car project using Raspberry Pi Pico, Arduino Uno, and Bluetooth (HC-05) modules. Hand gestures wirelessly control the carâ€™s movement using MicroPython and Arduino. Built as a DIY embedded systems + robotics project.

The Gesture Controlled Car project successfully demonstrates the integration of hardware components and wireless communication to create an intuitive, hands-free method of controlling a robotic vehicle. By combining the capabilities of the MPU6050 accelerometer, Raspberry Pi Pico, HC-05 Bluetooth modules, Arduino Uno, and L298N motor driver, the system is able to detect and interpret hand movements in real time and convert them into corresponding movements of a car.

The project is a practical example of how embedded systems and IoT principles can be used to design intelligent, user-friendly solutions. It not only enhances understanding of sensor data handling, serial communication, and motor control, but also offers insight into how modern human-machine interfaces are designed.

While the project is currently limited to basic directional movement and a short-range Bluetooth connection, it serves as a strong foundation for future developments. It can be expanded to include features such as obstacle detection, speed control, long-range communication, and even AI-based gesture recognition.

Overall, this project reflects a successful application of theoretical knowledge into a working real-world model. It has immense potential for use in assistive technologies, robotics research, and educational platforms, inspiring innovation in contactless control systems and interactive automation.
